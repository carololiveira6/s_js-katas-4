# Activity: JavaScript Katas (Arrays, Functions, DOM)

### Overview ###

A [kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)) is an individual exercise where you practice a programming skill through repetition.
You will use the katas in this assessment to practice writing Javascript functions that use loops, conditionals, expressions, and arrays.

You will create a single web page to display the output from each of your functions, with a labeled heading for each individual exercise 
followed by your solution. **All outputs for the individual katas need to be displayed using `document.createElement()` and associated 
methods.** After appending the output of your function to the page, each function should use the 'return' statement to return its output.

Hint: when displaying an array, use `JSON.stringify()` to 'prettify' the output. For example, lets say you use `document.createElement()` 
and store it into a variable called `newElement`.  To display `lotrCitiesArray` on this element, you can call:

`newElement.textContent = JSON.stringify(lotrCitiesArray);`

**Example**

```
    let header = document.createElement("div");
    header.textContent = "Kata 1";
    document.body.appendChild(header);
    
    function kata1() {
        let newElement = document.createElement("div");
        newElement.textContent = JSON.stringify(lotrCitiesArray);
        document.body.appendChild(newElement)

        return lotrCitiesArray; // Don't forget to return your output!
    }
```
Don't forget to call your function after you define it!

`kata1();`

It might be beneficial to write a helper function that can be called within each kata function, which could be responsible for taking care of creating new 
elements, assigning text/content to the new elements, and then appending the new elements to the page.  However, this is not required.

Several of the katas will use the following sample variables, which you can copy and paste into your code:

```js
const gotCitiesCSV = "King's Landing,Braavos,Volantis,Old Valyria,Free Cities,Qarth,Meereen";
```

```js
const lotrCitiesArray = ["Mordor","Gondor","Rohan","Beleriand","Mirkwood","Dead Marshes","Rhun","Harad"];
```

```js
const bestThing = "The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong you are only off by a bit";
```

### Katas
1.  Write a function that returns an array with the cities in 'gotCitiesCSV'.  Remember to also append the results to the page.
2.  Write a function that returns an array of words from the sentence in 'bestThing'. Remember to also append the results to the page.

5.  Write a function that returns an array with the first 5 cities in 'lotrCitiesArray'. Remember to also append the results to the page.
6.  Write a function that returns an array with the last 5 cities in 'lotrCitiesArray'. Remember to also append the results to the page.
7.  Write a function that returns an array with the 3rd to 5th city in 'lotrCitiesArray'. Remember to also append the results to the page.

13.  Write a function that uses 'slice' to return a string with the last 12 characters from 'bestThing'. Remember to also append the results to the page.
14.  Write a function that uses 'slice' to return a string with the characters between the 23rd and 38th position of 'bestThing' (i.e., 'boolean is even'). Remember to also append the results to the page.
15.  Write a function that does the exact same thing as #13 but use the 'substring' method instead of 'slice'. Remember to also append the results to the page.
16.  Write a function that does the exact same thing as #14 but use the 'substring' method instead of 'slice'. Remember to also append the results to the page.
17.  Write a function that finds and returns the index of 'only' in 'bestThing'. Remember to also append the results to the page.
18.  Write a function that finds and returns the index of the last word in 'bestThing'. Remember to also append the results to the page.
19.  Write a function that finds and returns an array of all cities from 'gotCitiesCSV' that use double vowels ('aa', 'ee', etc.). Remember to also append the results to the page.
20.  Write a function that finds and returns an array with all cities from 'lotrCitiesArray' that end with 'or'. Remember to also append the results to the page.
21.  Write a function that finds and returns an array with all the words in 'bestThing' that start with a 'b'. Remember to also append the results to the page.
22.  Write a function that returns 'Yes' or 'No' if 'lotrCitiesArray' includes 'Mirkwood'. Remember to also append the results to the page.
23.  Write a function that returns 'Yes' or 'No' if 'lotrCitiesArray' includes 'Hollywood'. Remember to also append the results to the page.
24.  Write a function that returns the index of 'Mirkwood' in 'lotrCitiesArray'. Remember to also append the results to the page.
25.  Write a function that finds and returns the first city in 'lotrCitiesArray' that has more than one word. Remember to also append the results to the page.
26.  Write a function that reverses the order of 'lotrCitiesArray' and returns the new array. Remember to also append the results to the page.
27.  Write a function that sorts 'lotrCitiesArray' alphabetically and returns the new array. Remember to also append the results to the page.
28.  Write a function that sorts 'lotrCitiesArray' by the number of characters in each city (i.e., shortest city names go first) and return the new array. Remember to also append the results to the page.
29.  Write a function that uses 'pop' to remove the last city from 'lotrCitiesArray' and returns the new array. Remember to also append the results to the page.
30.  Write a function that uses 'push' to add back the city from 'lotrCitiesArray' that was removed in #29 to the back of the array and returns the new array. Remember to also append the results to the page.
31.  Write a function that uses 'shift' to remove the first city from 'lotrCitiesArray' and returns the new array. Remember to also append the results to the page.
32.  Write a function that uses 'unshift' to add back the city from 'lotrCitiesArray' that was removed in #31 to the front of the array and returns the new array. Remember to also append the results to the page.

# Requirements #
